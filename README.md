# Pagan Online Item Search

A Pagan Online fansite that help you search for items drop location and information.

You can find the site here: https://arrowvulcan.github.io/Pagan-Online/

Here is the database: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K96Um2uKOu03ILVPHs_DkTzZ-41XSVabbULXDVQciRE/edit?usp=sharing
While having the database fully open is nice, it may fast be abused and/or have small and quick changes with mistakes that may break things.
If you want to have access, please message me.

I will be adding info all the time while I play the game, so it will fill up overtime regardless.
